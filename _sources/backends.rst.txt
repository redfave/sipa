Datasource
----------

Sipa distinguishes between two concepts:

* A *Datasource* is the technical entity providing data, such as the
  user class, the mail server, etc.
* A *Dormitory* is the entity that should be displayed as an option on
  the login field.  Therefore, its most important property is the
  `display_name` and the datasource it belongs to.  Also, it holds information about the IP
  subnets, since these are bound to a location, and not the technical backend.
